Basically for this test  after giving the mcq round i was reading the code given to decode and fix errors i don't know c++ i only know little c, java and python.
Since i know a bit of c i was able to understand some of the texts and know what the code meant 
there was an issue with the hexstring area and the copying of iTOW,lon and lat in same buffer 
But since i didn't know how to fix them i asked chatgpt to provide me with the syntax to fix it i don't know if it actually did it looked okay to me
Since i'm a first year student all this is new to me but i'm learning and i saw that chatgpt made some changes i understood the changes. The code basically said that there is a ubx file in hex form then converting the hex into bytes using hextobytes. Then classId or something is used to convert  to human readable GPS coordinates from gpsdata. There is some part in middle function which i didn't understand
Then it was time for the path planning of the rover which made think of the chapter vectors in physics and maths so for movement i'm sure vectors is used so i asked chatgpt to make a code for 2D movements of the rover which is only four direction(left,right,forward,backward) since i didn't know to code it but i know that the implementation of matrices and vectors are being used. I saw the program made by chatgpt and i tried understanding it some parts i did and some i didn't i'm not going to lie. It wrote some things for the obstacles and free space too.
For the odometry commands part i was kind of clueless but i thought that maybe angles and some physics is going to be used in our code so i asked again to chatgpt for a prompt for the movement of rover along generated path. As i saw the code i saw that yes angles are used and a lot other things like linear and angular velocity which i understood and something called heading error i read that code trying to understand how that works my controller only accepts one command per target cell because it is a simple demo. I think i learnt a lot from this test, i thought i was going to show all that i've learnt but instead in this test i learnt more than i showed my learning. 
That is it. Thank you making me learn so much.
Hope you consider me!
