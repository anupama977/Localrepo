Basically for this test  after giving the mcq round i was reading the code given to decode and fix errors i don't know c++ i only know little c, java and python.
Since i know a bit of c i was able to understand some of the texts and know what the code meant 
there was an issue with the hexstring area and the copying of iTOW,lon and lat in same buffer 
But since i didn't know how to fix them i asked chatgpt to provide me with the syntax to fix it i don't know if it actually did it looked okay to me
Since i'm a first year student all this is new to me but i'm learning and i saw that chatgpt made some changes i understood the changes. The code basically said that there is a ubx file in hex form then converting the hex into bytes using hextobytes. Then classId or something is used to convert  to human readable GPS coordinates from gpsdata. There is some part in middle function which i didn't understand
